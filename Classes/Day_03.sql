/*
Clauses are components of a SQL statement that specify the actions to be performed on the data in a database.
Each clause serves a specific purpose and helps to define the structure and behaviour of the SQL query.
Clauses can be combined to create complex queries that retrieve, manipulate or manage data.

the main clauses in MySQL include:
SELECT: Retrieves data from a database table.
FROM: Specifies the table(s) to retrieve data from.
WHERE: Filters data bases on one or more columns.
GROUP BY: Group data based on one or more columns.
HAVING: Filters grouped data based on conditions.
ORDER BY: Sorts data in ascending or descending order.
LIMIT: Limits the number of rows returned.

1. WHERE Clause
The WHERE clause is used to filter records in a table based on specific conditions.
It is typically used with SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements.

Syntax:

SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

2. Distinct Clause
The DISTINCT Clause is used to return unique values from a column by removing duplicates in the result set.

Syntax:

SELECT DISTINCT column 1
FROM table_name;

3. FROM Clause
The FROM Clause specifies the table or tables from which the data is retrieved.
It is mandatory part of SELECT statement and can also be used with joins for combining data from multiple tables

Syntax:
 SELECT column1, column2
 FROM table_name;
 
 4. ORDER BY Clause
 The ORDER BY Clause is used to sort the result set in ascending (ASC) or descending(DESC) order based on one or more columns.
 
 Syntax:
 
 SELECT column1, column2
 FROM table_name
 ORDER BY column_name[ASC|DESC];
 
 5. GROUP BY Clause
 The GROUP BY Clause groups rows with the same value into summary rows,
 often used with aggregate functions(e.g., COUNT, SUM, AVG).
 
 Syntax:
 
 SELECT column1, aggregate_funtion(column2)
 FROM table_name
 GROUP BY column1;
 
 6. HAVING Clause
 The HAVING Clause is used to filter grouped data after the GROUP By clause.
 It works similarly to the WHERE clause but is applied to aggregated results.

 SELECT Query:
 The SELECT Statement is used to retrieve data from a database table.
 It allows you to specify the columns you want to fetch and apply conditions to filter the results.
 
 Syntax:
 SELECT column1, column2,...
 FROM table_name
